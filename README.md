## Guess the MLB World Series Champion Team

Play the classic game hangman with a Major League Baseball theme. An image will appear as a hint of the team to guess. The player will get three tries (pitches) to guess letters which make up the team. If the player selects an incorrect letter which is not in the team name they will receive a strike. However, if the player does select a correct letter within the team name they will be allowed to continue to guess more letters. If the team name is not guessed before receiving three strikes the player will received a strike out. However, if the team name is guess correctly the player will received a Home Run. Ready to see how many home runs you can get? If so then letâ€™s play ball!
